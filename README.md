# Let me introduce you my version of currency converter, that was build for belarusians.

### Converter was build with help of NBRB API
With help of this app you can see actual currency exchange rates and also you can use exchange calculator.

### Used technologies:
- React
- Redux
- Redux Thunk

My favorite feature of this app is that you can send me an email and this feature was made with **emailJS**.
